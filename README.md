## MiniGrep 😎

- A command line tool written in **rust** that `searches for word in a file and prints them to console` (somewhat similar to grep).

### Usage:

```bash
# 1. clone the repo
# 2. To run the program, use command:
cargo run -- frog poem.txt
```

- It requires two arguments:
  - pattern to search for 🤓
  - filename 🧑🏻‍💻
